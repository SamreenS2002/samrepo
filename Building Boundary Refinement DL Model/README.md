# 📐 Boundary Refinement in Convolutional Neural Networks

**🎯 Project Objective**
This folder documents the technical process of refining decision boundaries within Deep Learning models. In image classification, boundary refinement ensures that the model can accurately distinguish between complex patterns with minimal error.

**🛠️ Technical Focus Areas**

**CNN Architecture:** Utilizing layers to extract features and define classification boundaries for image data.

**Pixel-Level Precision:** Analyzing how the model "decides" on a category when an image sits on the edge (the boundary) of two different classes.

**Loss Optimization:** Refining the mathematical "border" to reduce false positives and improve the model's confidence in its predictions.
