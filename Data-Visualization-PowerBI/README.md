# 📊 Strategic Sales Intelligence Dashboard

“Translating raw transactions into a visual narrative for executive decision-making.”

**🎯 Project Overview**

This project showcases the transition from data engineering to Business Intelligence. I transformed a chaotic set of sales records into a structured, interactive dashboard designed to reveal performance trends and regional growth opportunities.

**🛠️ Technical Implementation**
**Data Modeling:** Established complex relationships between sales tables, product categories, and time dimensions.

**DAX & Measures:** Created custom calculations to track Month-over-Month (MoM) growth and Year-to-Date (YTD) performance.

**UI/UX Design:** Implemented slicers and drill-through filters to allow stakeholders to move from "Big Picture" views down to specific product details.

**💎 Key Analytics**

**Automated Trend Detection:** Developed visuals that highlight seasonal peaks, allowing for better inventory planning.

**Regional Performance Insight:** Identified specific geographic zones where product penetration was below target.

**Product Hierarchy:** Grouped items by performance tiers to help focus marketing efforts on high-margin categories.
