# Clinical Data Interpretation

**Project Goal:** To perform a deep-dive analysis into the Heart Disease UCI dataset to identify significant health indicators.

**Technical Implementation:** Utilized Pandas for data cleaning and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization.

**Key Analytical Findings:** Observed that 'oldpeak' (ST depression) showed a strong linear separation in relation to heart disease presence.

**Verification:** Verified that chest pain type ('cp') remains a primary categorical indicator in patient records.
