# 🩺 Clinical Data Interpretation & Insights
“Analyzing data with integrity to uncover truths that matter.”

**🎯 Project Overview**

This project involves a rigorous, deep-dive analysis of the Heart Disease UCI dataset. The primary objective was to move beyond raw numbers and identify the most significant biological indicators that correlate with heart disease presence.

**🛠️ Technical Implementation**

I utilized a professional Python-based data science stack to ensure accuracy and reproducibility:

**Data Wrangling:** 
Implemented with Pandas for robust cleaning, handling missing values, and data normalization.

**Visualization:**
Leveraged Seaborn and Matplotlib to create high-dimensional plots that reveal hidden patterns.

**Statistical Methodology:**
Applied correlation matrices and distribution analysis to validate feature importance.
