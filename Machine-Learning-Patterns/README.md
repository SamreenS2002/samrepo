# Market Basket Analysis (Apriori Algorithm)

**Project Goal:** Discovering hidden relations between products in large retail datasets. 


**Technical Methodology:** Implemented the Apriori Algorithm to analyze frequent itemsets in transactional databases. 



**Parameters:** Optimized the model using min_support=0.01, min_confidence=0.02, and min_lift=1. 


**Library:** Leveraged the 'apyori' library for rule generation and data processing. 





**Key Metrics:** Utilized Support, Confidence, and Lift to evaluate the "strongness" of association rules.#
